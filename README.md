# ML-Python-Libraries

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) for learning and practicing popular Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Each notebook focuses on a specific library and provides tutorials, examples, and explanations to help you understand and utilize the features and functionalities of these libraries effectively.

## Notebooks

### Numpy.ipynb

The `Numpy.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive tutorial on the Numpy library, which is widely used for numerical computing in Python. It covers topics such as creating Numpy arrays, basic operations on arrays, array indexing and slicing, mathematical functions, statistical operations, and more. The notebook also includes hands-on examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding of Numpy.

### Pandas.ipynb

The `Pandas.ipynb` notebook focuses on the Pandas library, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. It covers essential concepts such as creating Pandas DataFrames, importing and exporting data from various sources, data cleaning and preprocessing, data filtering and selection, aggregation and grouping, merging and joining datasets, and more. The notebook includes practical examples and use cases to demonstrate the versatility and functionality of Pandas.

### Matplotlib.ipynb

In the `Matplotlib.ipynb` notebook, you will explore the Matplotlib library, which is widely used for data visualization in Python. It covers different types of plots and charts, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and 3D plots. The notebook provides detailed explanations of various customization options, such as colors, markers, labels, titles, legends, and annotations. It also demonstrates how to create visually appealing and informative visualizations using Matplotlib.

### Seaborn.ipynb

The `Seaborn.ipynb` notebook focuses on the Seaborn library, which builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It covers topics such as scatter plots, line plots, count plots, bar charts, histograms, distribution plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps. The notebook explains how to customize the aesthetics of the plots, apply different color palettes, and utilize advanced functionalities offered by Seaborn to gain valuable insights from your data.

Feel free to explore and run these notebooks to learn and practice using these Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and example datasets to help you grasp the concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you need to have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

- Numpy: For numerical computing and array operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and aesthetics.

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies and ensure a clean and isolated environment for running these notebooks.
